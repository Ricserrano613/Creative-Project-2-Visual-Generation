During our last class meet (Not counting the 1st year student presentation), I had worked with both Day and Melany to storyboard a mock video with the idea of Visual Generation in mind. We had came up with a pretty unique story that was only created because I could not stop looking at the fruit Day was eating. During storyboarding, I couldnt help but wonder how we could create a video where the fruit day was holding could be morphed into something more surreal, like if the tangerine in his hand had suddenly turned into a handful of tiny worms. 

Later that week, I had came across a series of surrealist work and videos which furtherd my agenda of creating a similar video. Peter Smith had shown me the image of "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dali and how Bizarre the image was. Although I had seen it plenty of times in popular media over the years, I never gave myself the chance to actually look at the painting:

I had then came across a video clip of a Dreamcast video game that I had not seen in years: LSD Dream Emulator. A 1998 Exploration game centered around exploring bizarre and surreal environments:

These bizarre elements of surrealism led me to question if I could make a video similar to this (in my own fashion) centered around a single object. I thought of the most simple thing I could at the time which was milk. If I could create a small video centered around milk and add concepts of surrealism to that, I can create a really cool/trippy one-minute experience. 

The result was me storyboarding an Idea similar to the one me, Day and Melonay created in class:

This took about a week and a half total of project creation. I work full time and I needed help, so I could not start filming throughout the week as I did not have the time. Instead, I reserved a saturday morning with my closest friend to film in my backyard, then drive to the nearest public park to film there as well. The filming was the easy part, as it took just under 2 hours to finish, It was organizning the video files into my hardrive and then creating a sequence on Premiere Pro that took longer. And of course, utilizing EbSynth to synthesize these videos for me was the most time consuming part. In total, it took about 2 days to fully edit. Something I am very proud of. 

This is a video I take much pride in, as it helps further my reasearch/experiment into my final studio project, which is to create a short A.I. Film, just on a larger scale and with more runtime. 

I really hope you enjoy this as much as I did! This is something I am putting into my resume and demo reel guaranteed!
