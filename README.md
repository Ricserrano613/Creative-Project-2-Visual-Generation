## Welcome to Prototype Milk!

## Background

This was a small film created by me in about a week-in-a-halfs time. 
The idea was concieved on paper drawn into a storyboard:

 I had shot the entire video on Saturday for about two hours, wrapped up, then spent the next two days editing this video, and it was AMAZING!

 ## Instructions
 If you would like to create a similar video, here are the applications you will need: 
 -Adobe Premiere Pro
 -Adobe After Effects
 -Adobe Photoshop
 -Adobe Audition
 -EbSynth
 -Dreamstudio.AI
 -Voice.AI
 -A hardrive(Optional,but highly recommended)
Definitely alot, but absolutely worth it. Let's go! 

## Step 1
Assuming you have already filmed your video, this is how to get started: 
Upload all of your video files into Adobe Premiere pro. You may organize the files however you feel necessary, I personally like to label certain files as Scene 1 , Scene 2, etc. You could also do this same process on After Effects if you are more comfortable, but I personally like to create full videos in premiere.

## Step 2
Create your sequence and place your video clips into said sequence, be sure to adjust your sequence so that it matches with the properties of your video(Example, if your video properties show the clip is in 1920x1080 format recorded at 60fps, be sure the sequence match those settings as well).

## Step 3
Right click whichever clip you would like to use for your AI generation/synthesis, right click and select "Replace with After Effects composition". This will take the clip you selected into After Effects. 

## Step 4
This is the interesting part. With your clip, export in After Effects under "PNG Sequence". This could take some time depending on how long the original clip is, so choose your clips wisely. Create a file in your computer/hardrive under the name "OUTPUT VIDEOS". This will be the folder where you will store multiple clips exported as frames.

## Step 5
This is where you open photoshop. After Effects should have exported all of your frames into your OUTPUT folder, open ONLY THE FIRST FRAME in photoshop. This will serve as the AI template for the rest of the frames in your video file.

## Step 6
Get creative! Sometimes I used photoshop and just added filters or downloaded images to place into my frame. For optimal results, you can used this same image frame for use in Dreamstudio.AI, this is where I created a large amount of my scenes:

## Step 7
Once you are done creating your alternate frame. Export the file as a PNG into a created "KEYFRAMES" Folder. This will serve as the edited frames for EbSynth. 

## Step 8
Open EbSynth. You will see file locations marked "KEYFRAMES", "VIDEO", "OUTPUT". To help you understand better, view it like this: 

- KEYFRAMES is where you will import your edited photoshop frame, you should already have it in your created "KEYFRAMES" folder.

- Video is where you will import all the frames from your "OUTPUT" Folder. But don't worry! You only have to select the very first original frame, the same one you used to upload on photoshop. 

- Output is where the synthesized video will be exported to. Create another folder on your hardrive named "OUTPUT". 

Make sure the stop mark is at 0(the current frame) as well as the keyframe mark, and make sure the "Stop" option is the same amount of frames your clip has. For example, if the png sequence you exported from After Effects is 366 frames, make sure stop is set to 366.

## Step 9
Import your new folder back into After Effects, EbSynth will have created a new sequence of PNG frames in your output folder. When importing, select "PNG Sequence" so after effects understands it will upload a large amount of images from your output folder. 

## Step 10
Once imported, drag into your AE Sequence and EXPORT the video as a .mp4 or .mov file, Created a "Synthesized Videos" file, this will have animated your new Scene! 

## Step 11
Import into Premiere and watch how it plays out! From here, you can get as creative as you want. You may also use Voice.AI like I did to add more content into the video, I also used Adobe Audition to edit my AI generated voice to sound a little more authentic. This is an optional step however!

## Step 12 
Rinse and Repeat! Enjoy your cool video!
